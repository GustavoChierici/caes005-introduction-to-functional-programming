# Control Flow

- You should try not to use control flow constructs
- Instead, write functions using guard clauses and pattern matching of parameters whenever possible.

## if and unless

## cond

- list a series of conditions

- FizzBuzz examples (Thomas, 2018)

## case

- First pattern that matches
- May include guard clauses

## raise

- "exceptions in Elixir are not control-flow structures." (Thomas, 2018)

- "The trailing exclamation point in the method name is an Elixir conventionâ€”if you see it, you know the function will raise an exception on error, and that exception will be meaningful." (Thomas, 2018)
